This project is created for the purpose of automatisation of files' restoring procees at web-site files.mail.ru.

The program is searching for "cfg.xml" in the root directory, which contains logins & passwords of the accounts. It has the following structure:

<root>
	<account>
		<login />
		<password />
	</account>
	<account>
		<login2 />
		<password2 />
	</account>
<root>

You also will need Selenium Web Driver. It could be found here: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/, under the section Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings/Java. It could be placed at the root in "lib" directory, for example.
